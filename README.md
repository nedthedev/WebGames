# WebGames
A collection of web based games I've built, and will add to it as I make more :D

I created these a while back and had them running secretly on my old website. I built them in Vue and Vuex (for state management), but am planning on making a cleaner Vue/Vuex version, as well as a bare JS version that perhaps instead uses cookies to store the game states.

## Minesweeper
The classic, recreated for the modern web.

## BlackBox
An old Parker Bros game where you have to determine where the marbles are based on how the light beams through the black box.

## Survo
The math game where you have to determine what numbers have to go where in the grid to get to the relative sum in each row.
